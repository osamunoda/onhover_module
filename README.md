# onhover_module

I introduced mouseover trigger technique 3 years ago, but recently I realized that I overlooked the easier way to do that.
 
Even the focus is on filemaker field (the webviewer doesn't have focus),
mouseenter,mouseout,mouseover,mouseleave,mousemove events occurs in the web viewer.
No need to do bother things I did before.
( old way:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHy0a3T8PWI )

Just implement mouseenter / mouseout event handlers.(Basic pattern)

onhover_module.fmp12 is the sample file of this technique.

Have fun!

I tested this file on Mac Sierra, FileMaker ver15 only.
Maybe it works on El capitan, FileMaker ver14~
